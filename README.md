# Emotion-Recognition-from-eeg-signals
This repository contains information on emotion recognition from eeg signals 
The data set used is DEAP data set and fft transformation was used for pre-processing the signals.
MAchine learning algorithms such as KNN, SVM and decision tree were used to build models and its respective accuracies were investigated.
